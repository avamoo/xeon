# Xeon

**Xeon** is a one-of-a-kind package manager for Linux,  
hoping to create easy ways to download, add, and remove files from our database.

## Small as you can get it!

This program is trying to be as compact as possible.  
It will barely scratch your available space :D  

## Free space you need

For safety, atleast have **10MB** of storage.  
But, don't you worry, **Xeon** wipes that off once it's done with it!  

## Installation

A tiny raw Python file will be in this repo,  
just download it, and execute!
  
## Add a package to Xeon

If you wanna add a package to **Xeon**,  
read **Adding.md**.  
  
Enjoy your adventure of packaging.
