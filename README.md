# Xeon

**Xeon** is a one-of-a-kind package manager for Linux,  
hoping to create easy ways to download, add, and remove files from our database.

## Small as you can get it!

This program is trying to be as compact as possible.  
It will barely scratch your available space :D  

## Free space you need

For safety, atleast have **10MB** of storage. It's currently 11.7 KiB!   
But, don't you worry, **Xeon** wipes garbage off once it's done with it!  

## Installation

An executable will be in releases. It will set  
the folders up the first time you use it.
  
## Add a package to Xeon

If you wanna add a package to **Xeon**,  
read **Adding.md**.  
  
Enjoy your adventure of packaging.
